# dotfiles

## My setup
Work: macOS (MacBook Pro 2017), whatever the latest version of macOS is
Home: macOS (MacBook Pro 2010 #oldskool), running macOS 10.14 (Mojave) - the latest it will support

Versioned using [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

// TODO:

- Split up vimrc into organised sections and possibly files, explore switching to neovim
- Write install script
