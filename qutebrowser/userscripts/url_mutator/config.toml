# this is a TOML document
# this document is a configuration for URL Mutator, a userscript for Qutebrowser

# these are global configuration options, they apply to the behavior of the script when called
[global]
# there is nothing here, but the block is reserved in the event that global options are implemented

# these are the configured mutators. for every mutator, a new [mutator.x] entry must be added in [mutator].
# the in_url and ignore_pattern patterns must be written in valid regex, and in single quotes per TOML spec to be taken as literal strings.
# parts of in_url expressions you want to save to use in the mutated URL must be surrounded with parentheses.
# the out_url must be the URL to mutate to, with placeholders for parts of the unmutated URL (that you put in parentheses) you want to insert. The placeholders are integers surrounded by pipes,
# with the integer matching the index of the in_url expression you want to insert, iterating from 1
# parentheses are valid regex, so there may be times you put things in parentheses you do not want to use in the mutated URL. These will have an index also. You can ignore these by not using their index number.
# "percent_decode" must be a string literal, comma delimited list of numbers corresponding to the in_url indexes you want to percent decode.
